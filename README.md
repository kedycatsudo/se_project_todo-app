# Simple Todo App
This project is a simple, interactive Todo App built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to manage a list of tasks efficiently by providing features such as adding new todos, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks. Each todo item can have a name and an optional due date, which is displayed in a user-friendly format. The app uses form validation to ensure that only valid tasks are added, and each todo is assigned a unique identifier using UUID v4. The user interface includes modal popups for adding new tasks and provides real-time feedback for form errors. The codebase is modular, with separate components for todo items and form validation, making it easy to maintain and extend. This project is ideal for learning and demonstrating modern JavaScript practices, DOM manipulation, and user experience considerations in web development.
